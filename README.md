# Webshop application - React! ðŸ˜ƒ

This application is a game store built with React and TypeScript. Users can scroll through a list of games, see details about each game in a modal, and add games to a cart. The shopping cart handles adding, removing and updating games, as well as showing the total price. Users can fill out a form to complete the purchase. The application has a navigation bar to easily switch between the home page, the game page and the shopping cart.
